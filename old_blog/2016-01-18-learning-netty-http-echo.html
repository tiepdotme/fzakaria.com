      <h2>Learning Netty - Part 1</h2>
<p>I recently picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Netty-Action-Norman-Maurer/dp/1617291471">Netty in Action</a> - which has been a great to learn more about Netty. I've become more fascinated with Netty as I've delved farther into Reactive &amp; Asynchronous programming. Netty is a very powerful framework that simplifies a lot of the challenges with NIO programming however it is still difficult to find resources / examples of every day use cases.</p>
<h2>Echo HTTP</h2>
<p>Many examples online start with building an Echo Server & Client. However they use a simple TCP echo server - which although probably more reasonable for the server doesn't show a barebones HTTP setup.</p>
<p>The following is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> of a barebones setup of setting up an HTTP server and client. The example shows a few simple defaults such as the use of <em>HttpObjectAggregator</em>, <em>HttpServerCodec</em> and <em>SimpleChannelInboundHandler</em>.</p>
