  <p>This is a <em>public love letter</em> to <strong>redo</strong> &amp; the joy it brings building
software.</p>

<p>I remember when I first finished <a href="https://amzn.to/3cJLe9T">The Little Schemer</a> and wrote my first <em>semi</em> useful “JSON Diff” program. I was exalted. I was elated. I was ecstatic.</p>

<p>There is something magical when you learn Lisp that is really tough to convey over a blog post or short article. <strong>One must try it, to grok it</strong>.</p>

<p>I have not professionally used Lisp much since however it’s been immensely impactful in the way I think about &amp; construct software.</p>

<p><strong>Redo is this for build systems</strong>.</p>

    <p>You’ve likely heard everyone at the office or online proclaim that “K8s has eaten everyone’s lunch!” or that “everything should be in a docker container!”.</p>

<p>While there are advantages to the above methodologies; it’s very easy to have cargo-culted their adoption; especially for Kubernetes (K8s). I find the biggest problem however that there is a fundamental lacking of what is a <em>*container</em>.</p>

<p>There s a 1000 other posts online explaining containers and I’m adding my own to the pool. Perhaps this 1001th explanation will do so in such a way that it groks.</p>

<p>This is my attempt of a continuation of David Miller’s prior e-mail
<a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/xdp-newbies/msg00179.html">bpf.h and you…</a>.</p>

<p>I was curious about how ebpf filters are wired and work. The heavy use of C
macros makes the source code difficult for me to comprehend.</p>

<p>I’m hoping others may find this exploratory-dive insightful – hopefully,
it’s accurate enough.</p>

    <p>Hello World.</p>

<p>I’ve moved my blog from “Small Thoughts” <a href="http://blog.fzakaria.com">blog.fzakaria.com</a>, which was hosted on Wordpress &amp; S3, one using Jekyll via Github Pages.</p>

<p>Why Github Pages and not S3 still? I wanted to see what all the fuss was about &amp; it sounded simpler to set up the TLS certificates.</p>

<p>You may notice that the theme of this blog is <strong>very</strong> similar to that
of <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew Devault’s</a>; in fact, it is based on his published theme.</p>

<p>I admired on his blog his <a href="https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog">campaign</a> to get others blogging that I revived my forgotten blog. I enjoyed the minimalism of his blog and embraced it. The site uses very minimal <em>fancy</em> Jekyll plugins, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/fzakaria/fzakaria.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m still a novice to Jekyll &amp; blogging in general; feel empowered to reach out to teach me or discuss.</p>
